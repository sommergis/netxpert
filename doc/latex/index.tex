net\+Xpert++ is a library for solving network analysis problems on spatial networks written in C++ 11. The main goals of the library are performance and simplicity of the A\+PI.

{\bfseries Solver\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item shortest path solver (1-\/1, 1-\/n, 1-\/all)
\item origin destination matrix (no geometry, straight lines, real geometries)
\item transportation solver
\item minimum cost flow solver
\item minimum spanning tree
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Features\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item respects barrier geometries
\item respects oneway arcs
\item database backed
\item Bindings for Python, C\# through S\+W\+IG
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Performance\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use of highly efficient graph analysis algorithms and data structures (L\+E\+M\+ON, future Boost Graph Library)
\item multiprocessing where reasonable with Open\+MP
\end{DoxyItemize}
